*** Whats is this?
    This a blog. It is edited in emacs org. It is exported to MD by
    [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]], and generated into a static site with Hudo, using the
    book theme. I wanted a way to make my many and various notes in my
    org journal more centralised, and more useful in the future.  
    I like the book theme because it has a TOC. I am a fan
    of the Cornell note taking system. [[/images/cornell.webp.png]] 
    Cornell notes have a focus on revision and skim-ability. I wanted
    a blog site where I had a TOC I could use like the left hand
    "keyword" column of this note system. That is to say. cover the
    content, and use the keywords or key questions to revise what was
    written. I often find myself writing my org journal headlines in
    question format. But the answer are forgotten soon after i have
    solved that problem and moved on to the next. I think If I had a
    output for these notes, it would encourage me to keep them
    neater. If they are neat they can form a support for my
    professional accumulation of knowledge, and the ability to do the
    thing. As it stands, even though I have done many amazing things once, I'm
    not sure I could do them again any easier or quicker.
    
    All the content is kept in one file content-org/all-posts.org. It
    is exported with =C-c C-e H A=. Which triggers ox-hugo to make a
    md file for each Headding in the file.

    [[https://mstempl.netlify.com/post/static-website-with-emacs-and-hugo/][This guy helped]] me when I googled how to do this. 
**** What now?
     - [ ] Learn more about how to format things in org files so I can
       output a pretty well formated blog
     - [ ] Get a better idead of how to controll the menues and things of
       the book theme
     - [ ] Make this integrated with netlify so i can just push
       changes to github and have it update the site
     - [ ] make the edit this page go to the org file.
     - [ ] add some more blog like features to the book blog pages
       - [ ] tags and things
       - [ ] next and previous etc
     - [ ] get the export on save thing working
