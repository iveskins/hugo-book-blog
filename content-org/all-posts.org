*** Whats is this?
    This a blog. It is edited in emacs org. It is exported to MD by
    [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]], and generated into a static site with Hudo, using the
    book theme. I wanted a way to make my many and various notes in my
    org journal more centralised, and more useful in the future.  
    I like the book theme because it has a TOC. I am a fan
    of the Cornell note taking system. [[/images/cornell.webp.png]] 
    Cornell notes have a focus on revision and skim-ability. I wanted
    a blog site where I had a TOC I could use like the left hand
    "keyword" column of this note system. That is to say. cover the
    content, and use the keywords or key questions to revise what was
    written. I often find myself writing my org journal headlines in
    question format. But the answer are forgotten soon after i have
    solved that problem and moved on to the next. I think If I had a
    output for these notes, it would encourage me to keep them
    neater. If they are neat they can form a support for my
    professional accumulation of knowledge, and the ability to do the
    thing. As it stands, even though I have done many amazing things once, I'm
    not sure I could do them again any easier or quicker.
    
    All the content is kept in one file content-org/all-posts.org. It
    is exported with =C-c C-e H A=. Which triggers ox-hugo to make a
    md file for each Headding in the file.

** DONE Epwing dictionaries
   :PROPERTIES:

*** What is EPWING?
    It seems to be a legacy format for dictionary data, that was
    / is mostly used by Japanese electronic dictionaries. I remember
    someone complaining about its great inconsistency as a format, so
    as to make importing data from it difficult. It seems that there
    needs to be custom parsers written for each different publishers
    version of the format. I came across it as a Japanese learner. 
    The browser dictionary extension [[https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/][yomichan]] can import some of these
    to provide J:J [fn:: Japanese word with Japanese definition] look
    ups. The  J:J dictionaries I find most useful are the ones
    targeted at people of my reading level (kids). These are not
    available as EPWING. 
*** Why do I care?
    Because yomichan sometimes doesn't give you the defintion of
    longer phrases, and I wanted to find a dictionary that might have
    contained longer connected keywords, so I could make flashcards
    directly of those, instead of their component parts.
*** Why this post?  
    to remember that there is a big collection of them [[https://onedrive.live.com/?id=AC31052BF2B8CA11%211937&cid=AC31052BF2B8CA11][here]].

*** What is the a Finish gum I want to try.
    I was wondering if there was any endochrine disrupters in chewing
    gum. And that lead me to read some research papers about gum. The
    one i was reading was linking chewing flavorful gum to a reduction
    in slival stress hormone indicators [fn::salivary cortisol level -
    - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381771/ ] and in
      that it also mentioned that chewing speed has been shown to be a
      indicator of stress, so they had the participants chew at 70
      chews per minute to a metronone.. I wonder if you can look at
      people and make any assessment of their stress level by thei

r
      chewing speed.. Anyway this article mentioned an unpalatable
      gum, Fazer Salmiakki. Which I of course wanted to know why
      anyone would make unpalatable gum. But it's just that salty
      liquorice flavor.
