## Thursday, 11/28/19 {#thursday-11-28-19}

-   [A swiss army knife tool for data transformation and analysis for
    Web apps](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)
    Could be useful when developing web apps, or troubleshooting
    issues with apps. I found it in relation to someone describing
    traffic to their host that was BASE64 encoded twice. You can
    chain transformation together. It also seems to have quite a few
    image forensic tools.
