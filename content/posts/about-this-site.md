## Whats is this? {#whats-is-this}

This a blog. It is edited in emacs org. It is exported to MD by
[ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/), and generated into a static site with Hudo, using the
book theme. I wanted a way to make my many and various notes in my
org journal more centralised, and more useful in the future.
I like the book theme because it has a TOC. I am a fan
of the Cornell note taking system. {{<figure src="/images/cornell.webp.png">}}
Cornell notes have a focus on revision and skim-ability. I wanted
a blog site where I had a TOC I could use like the left hand
"keyword" column of this note system. That is to say. cover the
content, and use the keywords or key questions to revise what was
written. I often find myself writing my org journal headlines in
question format. But the answer are forgotten soon after i have
solved that problem and moved on to the next. I think If I had a
output for these notes, it would encourage me to keep them
neater. If they are neat they can form a support for my
professional accumulation of knowledge, and the ability to do the
thing. As it stands, even though I have done many amazing things once, I'm
not sure I could do them again any easier or quicker.

All the content is kept in one file content-org/all-posts.org. It
is exported with `C-c C-e H A`. Which triggers ox-Hugo to make a
md file for each Headding in the file.
