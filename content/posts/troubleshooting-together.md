## Making Changes {#making-changes}

Aside from the general best practice of making changes in a
shared change controled environment (like not doing so without
prior planning and communication) When trouble shooting in an
environment that no-one is using for anything important currently,
it's still important to put everything back how you found it when
you're finished. This helps prevent configuration drift, and
breaking things for the next person.
When troubleshooting, you should keep a detailed and time ordered
list of the things you have done. Especially changes to
configuration, so you know how to reverse these chaneges after.
