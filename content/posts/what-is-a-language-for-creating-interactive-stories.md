Its [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md).

I can imagine using this to make an interacive story to run on a ebook
reader navigating through black and white images.
or [pubcoder](https://www.pubcoder.com/Features/Interactivity) or [apple ibook?](https://www.apple.com/ibooks-author/) or [kotobee](https://www.kotobee.com/blog/how-create-interactive-ebook-guide/)
or [Twine](https://twinery.org/) which is from the [Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation.](https://iftechfoundation.org/)
.. and used to make this cool interactive browser experience
[burnt matches](https://pippinbarr.com/games/burntmatches/). [morehere](https://www.pippinbarr.com/2016/11/29/burnt-matches/)

or to use with children in a coding skills and language development
situation. because it's so language bassed.. and then makes
interacctive content which encourages revision.. and the writing part
is like accuracy focused output .. and making a game is like
.. naturally you adapt from something else .. so there is pleanty of
chance to look at example text and adopt practical genre bassed
language patterns from it .. and re-write in your own way.. and there
is also the integration with art.. making assets for this game .. and
the coding language is very shallow learning curve but goes into
introducing some of the concepts of logical code thinking in a very
understandable ways..
