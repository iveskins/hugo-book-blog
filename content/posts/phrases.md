-   You could decide money and the rat race are pointless and
    decide to just stop pursuing it. And you'll survive... for a
    time. Then you won't be able to function in society. Won't be
    able to eat, or have a place to live, effectively the
    equivalent of having your skull bashed in like in that
    previous world.
-   there's a certain amount of hubris in assuming that you know
    better than the norms. Often, norms became norms because they
    work for a lot of people.

## Hyper-sane {#hyper-sane}

It is not just that the ‘sane’ are irrational but that they lack
scope and range, as though they’ve grown into the prisoners of
their arbitrary lives, locked up in their own dark and narrow
subjectivity. Unable to take leave of their selves, they hardly
look around them, barely see beauty and possibility, rarely
contemplate the bigger picture

## ontogeny {#ontogeny}

I’ve come to love this term ontogeny because it brings together,
in one helpful word, the flux of becoming that scientists as well

and storytelling habits.
