## [Economic anxiety, a policy pushed by financial planners, is what motivates. Not money.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20682564) {#economic-anxiety-a-policy-pushed-by-financial-planners-is-what-motivates-dot-not-money-dot}

-   You could decide money and the rat race are pointless and
    decide to just stop pursuing it. And you'll survive... for a
    time. Then you won't be able to function in society. Won't be
    able to eat, or have a place to live, effectively the
    equivalent of having your skull bashed in like in that
    previous world.
-   there's a certain amount of hubris in assuming that you know
    better than the norms. Often, norms became norms because they
    work for a lot of people.
-   Don't buy into the myths of scarcity and learned helplessness
    society uses to get people to play along. Everyone's capable
    of learning how to reconnect with and be an active contributor
    to nature. We


## Hyper-sane {#hyper-sane}

It is not just that the ‘sane’ are irrational but that they lack
scope and range, as though they’ve grown into the prisoners of
their arbitrary lives, locked up in their own dark and narrow
subjectivity. Unable to take leave of their selves, they hardly
look around them, barely see beauty and possibility, rarely
contemplate the bigger picture

-   NOTE: I'm not sure this is a thing


## "He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself." {#he-that-would-make-his-own-liberty-secure-must-guard-even-his-enemy-from-oppression-for-if-he-violates-this-duty-he-establishes-a-precedent-that-will-reach-to-himself-dot}

## long-range amorphous order {#long-range-amorphous-order}

“long-range amorphous order,” where each molecule feels and
affects the position of every other, so that in order to move,
they must move as one. The hidden long-range order of this
putative state could rival the more obvious orderliness of a
crystal. “That observation right there was at the heart of why
people thought there should be an ideal glass,"

-   perfect glass


## How an open-loop scrubber works {#how-an-open-loop-scrubber-works}

-   <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/29/thousands-of-ships-could-dump-pollutants-at-sea-to-avoid-dirty-fuel-ban>
-   Exhaust gas is sprayed with seawater to wash out sulphur oxide
-   Washwater is treated and monitored
-   Treated washwater is discharged into the sea


## ontogeny {#ontogeny}

I’ve come to love this term ontogeny because it brings together,
in one helpful word, the flux of becoming that scientists as well
as existentialists seek to understand. By rallying readers with
their slogan ‘existence precedes essence’, Beauvoir and Sartre
were drawing attention to the utterly singular way in which we
each become the selves that we are, with our own memories, stories
and storytelling habits.


### What point dod we become human? {#what-point-dod-we-become-human}

when humanity begun..
maybe it hasn't even started yet.. we havn't become human
yet.. we are skill walking apes.


## Forced filter {#forced-filter}

<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22744311>

-   Agreed. It's not the feed that broke the internet – it's the forced filter.

The notion that forced filtration, reprioritization, and chronological
rearrangement of content is implicit the idea of information feeds
(search, social media, etc) shows how deep the brokenness is
    baked in.

-   I've always imagined animals on a farm feeding happily at a trough, unaware of their impending doom.


## It's hard to make good choices when you're only surrounded by bad one. {#it-s-hard-to-make-good-choices-when-you-re-only-surrounded-by-bad-one-dot}

<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22744409>
You're spot on. But really... all people are basically the
same. And like Google, they're incentivized by the system to be
horrible to each other and/or horrible to the environment. I think
people all have a choice. But I think the good choices are really
hard to make when you're only surrounded by bad choices.

-   This sentiment reflects some of what I have been confronted with
    moving out of one society and culture into another. How our
    environment is a big limit on our choices and even perceptions
    of whats choosable.
