It was [Plumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/index.html)

-   Why Pulumi?

By using real languages for infrastructure as code, you get many
benefits: IDEs, abstractions including functions, classes, and
packages, existing debugging and testing tools, and more. The
result is greater productivity with far less copy and paste, and it
works the same way no matter which cloud you're targeting

Maybe I should give it a try. Terrafrom's domaon specific langaige
is a bit special.
