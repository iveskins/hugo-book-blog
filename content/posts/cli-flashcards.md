Someone asked on reddit linuxquestions about a commandline tool for
 doing flashcard revision like quizlet. I had a look into it thinking
 Immediatly of ANKI and emacs org mode. There is a tool to
 [edit anki cards in emacs](https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor). There is a [Drill](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html) minor mode for org that
 lets you do flashcards and srs.
 #BEGIN\_QUOTE
Org-Drill is an extension for Org mode. Org-Drill uses a spaced
 repetition algorithm to conduct interactive "drill sessions", using
 org files as sources of facts to be memorised. Each topic is treated
 as a "flash card". The material to be remembered is presented to the
 student in random order. The student rates his or her recall of each
 item, and this information is used to schedule the item for later
 revision.
\#END\_QUOTE
There is also [Pamparam](https://github.com/abo-abo/pamparam) "a new spaced repetition (SR) memory cards
 implementation for Emacs." which is under development recently.
