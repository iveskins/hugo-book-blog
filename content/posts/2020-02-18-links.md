## SSM Session manager for aws {#ssm-session-manager-for-aws}

This is a way to access aws things like EC2 instances without the
need for having a network ingress to port 22 and ssh.
It is manage by IAM and policies. So it is easier to audit than
SSH keys
It is not as good as ssh for tunneling and scp so
[Here is a way to use it to connect to ssh](https://github.com/elpy1/ssh-over-ssm)


## Discussion of VPNs and aws {#discussion-of-vpns-and-aws}

With all the news of global epidemics, it reminded me that the
office I am in at the moment
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/f2t9ds/aws_client_vpn_seems_like_a_rip_off_no/)
TIL:

-   AWS managed services are expensive. There is angry abusive
    reddit debate over if it is cheaper to pay engineers to make one
    on your own ec2 instances, or to pay for a managed VPN.
    [AWS vpn pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/pricing/)
-   If VPN is a critical thing, then there is an advantage to using
    the ASW service, in terms of avaliability and scaling etc
-   there are diferences in the pricing. OpenVPN charges per seat,
    otehrs might charge for uptime and throughput.
-   In a mass-surveilance world, why would I trust AWS VPN not to
    have a backdoor?
-   [pritunl](https://pritunl.com/#promo) is a commercial OpenVPN wrapper
    -   Pritunl has a free version that's excellent for simple use
        cases,
-   "would it be cheaper to just make a cloud formation template to
    spin up my own version of this service on demand?"
-   <https://github.com/joshmcgrath08/openvpn_on_ec2>
    -   explains how to make an ec2 instance with openVPN, and the
        template automatees to the extent that you also get a
        download link for the credentials needed to sign into it.

## The port-knocking on AWS {#the-port-knocking-on-aws}

the goal would be to keep your logs from being filled with junk
noise of auto scans. but still have a service online when you
needed it
[Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/6yks6t/the_portknock_protocol_and_aws_security_groups/) here.
I was interested in this because of the idea of having an endpoint
that you could call to add your current IP adress to a security
group through a lambda function or something .. then let yourself
into your ssh port, or what have you. but tunneling through
session manager might be another option.
