## SPEECH Computing {#speech-computing}

-   [Creating an open speech recognition dataset for (almost) any
    language](https://medium.com/@klintcho/creating-an-open-speech-recognition-dataset-for-almost-any-language-c532fb2bc0cf). This is a very detailed instructions on using audio
    books to make speech traning data

## Headless CMS {#headless-cms}

-   [Sheetsu](https://sheetsu.com/) with a japanese spelling form some reason.. uses google
    sheets as the source of data to make pages and tables and things
    .. could be useful for a toastmasters type situation where there
    is a static page to be made every month for the agenda
    etc.. that just needs data changed .. and has a lot of not tech
    fluent users - I found it here in this blog post about [headless cms](https://bejamas.io/blog/headless-cms/)


## Non-centralised social web {#non-centralised-social-web}

I found out about the [Indiweb wiki](https://indieweb.org/) which says it is "The IndieWeb
is a people-focused alternative to the "corporate web".". There I
read about [pingbacks](https://indieweb.org/pingback) and [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/webmention.io). Which seems to be a way of
linking together websites or blogs that make mentions of each
other in their writings. so I dont need twitter or facebook as a
gobetween. I found out about it from
[This blog](https://paul.kinlan.me/using-web-mentions-in-a-static-sitehugo-/) by Paul Kinlan talking about how to implement it in a
hugo site.. which seems to involve some code for including the
things on the page,.. and then some extra code in your static site
build stage to go and find or send out mentions. I think Paul
Kinlan is a chrome developer, and I found him reading about
progressive web apps as an way for web developers to appeal to
users who are being entraped by app walled gardens of in app
browsers and no external links etc.


## IT stuff {#it-stuff}

[The ombulabs](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog) blog has many intersting looking articles about how
to work well in it, and test code, upgrade rails, etc. very
sharing way of working .. if you can do something .. why not do it
well, document and share it and sell it as a consultancy service
.. that the kind of transparent working style that seems very
sustainable for everyone involved

-   [Koji](https://withkoji.com/docs/tutorials/creating-your-first-custom-vcc) is s code remixing platform trying to be the youtube of
    code.. they are paying for simple games to seed their library.


## Interactive text {#interactive-text}

-   [Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear
    stories.](https://twinery.org/) which looks pretty flexible .. it was used to make the
    game [Burnt matches](http://www.pippinbarr.com/2016/11/29/burnt-matches/) by the media researcher Pippin Barr.
    Which was a mix of text and interface and browser animation
    [speculative play](http://www.speculativeplay.com/about/) also looks interesting.
    Which I read about when reading about how to make an interactive
    epub [here](https://www.kotobee.com/blog/how-create-interactive-ebook-guide/) . I was thinking of how I could use my ereader in a
    more interesting way to navigate around some black and white
    photos.. or maybe use them to make an ereader point and click
    adventure game.. so I was readign about publishing tools for
    interactive epubs .. because Im not sure how advance the browser
    is on a kobo.. for handling normal html.. that page has a list
    of publishing tools that can out put as interactive epub. mostly
    as self promotion of itself Kotobee Author.
    if kobo can handle html5.. it might be worth looking into html
    game [engines](http://html5gameengine.com/)

-   Ink [ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md) also seems to be a very full featured game writing
    language like twine .. for pathed stories

-   [a list here](https://vagrantcursor.wordpress.com/2018/01/02/tools-to-make-narrative-games/) of tools to make interactive text


## List of games researches {#list-of-games-researches}

[here](http://www.kmjn.org/game-rankings/) . including my old lecturer .. found this by cross searching
his name and the developer of burnt matches.
