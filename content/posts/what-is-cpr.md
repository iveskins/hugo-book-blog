Not helping people clear their airways. I mean Corporate Political
Responsibility.
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRwgh8nYOcI) is a video about it.. but that doesn't really give a clear
defintion.. just the idea that things that hare happening
politically are relevant to business, and business should pay
attention to them? I think I need to listend a little more closely
to this one.
But It was interesting to see wikistage, somekind of more
internation alternative to TED talks.. that has a lot of content
for people from any country in bussiness, from what I could see..
It's strikes me that these images of people from other parts of the
world being endevering to make good businesses, etc... is much more
encouraging to me than seeing yet another American.. because I can
see the posibility of someone not from America, like me.. doing
something.
