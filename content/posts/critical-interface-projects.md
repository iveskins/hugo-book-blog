## Whats that idea you had about a poem from source code? {#whats-that-idea-you-had-about-a-poem-from-source-code}

   you read on [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19672436) that the source-code for ZORK1 had been
   uploaded to [gitlab](https://github.com/historicalsource?tab=repositories), and there was discussion of an unpublished
   hitchhikers guide sequel. Someone linked to the [Zaphod source](https://github.com/historicalsource/restaurant/blob/master/people.zil#L265-L268).
   this had a bit like
   #BEGIN\_SRC
   <CONSTANT LDESC-STRINGS
<PLTABLE	"dancing"
	       "sipping sherry"
       ;3	"watching you" ;"talking quietly"
	       "looking at you with suspicion"
	       0 ;"gazing out the window"
       ;6	"walking along"
	       "sobbing quietly"
	       "poised to attack"
       ;9	"waiting patiently"
	       "eating with relish"
	       "preparing dinner"
       ;12	"listening to you"
	       "lounging and chatting"
	       "asleep"
       ;15	0 ;"reading a note"
	       "listening"
	       "preparing to leave"
       ;18	"deep in thought"
	       "out cold"
	       "ignoring you"
       ;21	"searching"
	       "playing the piano"
	       "following you"
       ;24	"brushing her hair"
	       "looking sleepy">>
   #END\_SRC

which was kind of poetic. atleast in layout.. and It made you think
this was a vein that could be mined for artistic expression.
