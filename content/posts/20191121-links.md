#### What is the a Finish gum I want to try. {#what-is-the-a-finish-gum-i-want-to-try-dot}

I was wondering if there was any endocrine disrupters in chewing
gum. And that lead me to read some research papers about gum. The
one i was reading was linking chewing flavorful gum to a reduction
in saliva stress hormone indicators [fn::salivary cortisol level -

-   <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381771/> ] and in
    that it also mentioned that chewing speed has been shown to be a
    indicator of stress, so they had the participants chew at 70
    chews per minute to a metronone.. I wonder if you can look at
    people and make any assessment of their stress level by their
    chewing speed.. Anyway this article mentioned an unpalatable
    gum, Fazer Salmiakki. Which I of course wanted to know why
    anyone would make unpalatable gum. But it's just that salty
    licorice flavor.

I noticed today, that an image in my feed had text, one person
and airplane. It's an accessibility thing. If only they let my
just copy text from the mobile site.. sesh.. dont need AI to not
do anti-patterns for free use

a FS to keep track of bitrot. I since found someone who
automated this with raid1 set up..
