## What is the a Finish gum I want to try. {#what-is-the-a-finish-gum-i-want-to-try-dot}

I was wondering if there was any endocrine disrupters in chewing
gum. And that lead me to read some research papers about gum. The
one i was reading was linking chewing flavorful gum to a reduction
in saliva stress hormone indicators [fn::salivary cortisol level -

-   <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5381771/> ] and in
    that it also mentioned that chewing speed has been shown to be a
    indicator of stress, so they had the participants chew at 70
    chews per minute to a metronone.. I wonder if you can look at
    people and make any assessment of their stress level by their
    chewing speed.. Anyway this article mentioned an unpalatable
    gum, Fazer Salmiakki. Which I of course wanted to know why
    anyone would make unpalatable gum. But it's just that salty
    licorice flavor.
