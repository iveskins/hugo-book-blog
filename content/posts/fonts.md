## Why are web fonts used? {#why-are-web-fonts-used}

webfonts are used because fonts are considered intelectual
proprty, and have restrictive licensing. If a web designer wants
to use a font on a webpage it can be a big prblem to get the
licence to use it. by using a font api, you are using fonts that
are already licenced by google.
web fonts are also a way to make traffic more efficient, because
many sites would be sharing the same font data, so they can be
cached easier
it also means that only google gets to track you data, and not
lots of diferent font providers
without them we would be limited to looking at web pages in fonts
that are installed on the OS, and OSes all have diferent sets of
fonts, so pages would look diferent on diferent systems


## What fonts are on all systems? {#what-fonts-are-on-all-systems}

there are a few microsoft fonts that were released in the 90s that
can be found on linux to, but they have to be installed from a CAB
file.


## Spirals as base for font design {#spirals-as-base-for-font-design}

basically bu variying the value of a curve equation you can get
many types of curves, these curves can be put together in
descretly to make a shape. This work is about using a sipral
equation to make up fonts that look nice.

A man who worked on the google font project at launch, Raph
Levien, wrote a [PHD thesis](https://levien.com/phd/phd.html) called "From Spiral to Spline: Optimal
Techniques in Interactive Curve Design".
"The Euler spiral is an excellent choice for this generator
curve."
"the properties of the various interpolating splines
explored in this thesis, to facilitate choosing the best one for
any given application. In using these splines for drawing a
number of fonts, I also found they brought an aesthetic quality to
the work."
