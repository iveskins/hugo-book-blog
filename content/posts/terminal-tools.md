As the workstation I station my work at slowly evolves, I grow
forgetful of all the little things I have done to make it comfortable
and efficient.


## Command Line tools {#command-line-tools}


### [Lnav](http://lnav.org/) {#lnav}

Is a log file viewer with some great features for search, syntax
highlighting, and in / out filtering, that makes it realy quick
to understand the information in a log file. What is good about
it, is that it is powerful like having a log agergation platform,
but it is just a lightweight command line application.

### Htop {#htop}

is better than top
{{<figure src="/images/screenshot.htop.png">}}


### [Ranger](https://ranger.github.io/) {#ranger}

Is a "A VIM-inspired filemanager for the console". It can be used
for very quick navigation of files. it also integrates with
iterm, and other terminal apps to allow for preview of images.

### Termshark {#termshark}

[Termshark](https://github.com/gcla/termshark) is a A terminal UI for tshark, inspired by Wireshark
[About it](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/04/analyze-network-traffic-with-termshark.html). It seems the doccuments are a bit sparse. If there is
anythign that is unclear, it is probably something that can be
looked up in the wireshark docs.. like what scale a suration
number is in etc. these are just concepts taken directly from wireshark.

All my current dictionaries can be found it [this git repo](https://github.com/iveskins/google.input.dic)
I can't remember how I made them. but I am sure I just formatted
other peoples files in a way that can be inported to google
input.
e.g:

-   JAP-ENG

    There is a dictionary for displaying the English meaning of
    words typed in Japanse. useful
    {{<figure src="/images/ja-eng-words.png">}}
    and a dictionary for translating words typed in Japanse to
    English. not too useful for me.

-   Emoji dictionary

    [here](https://gist.github.com/iveskins/4b0c620f3e51968ff67453ac78f2fb59) is a gist of the dictionary file.
