[performance RNN](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/demos/performance_rnn/index.html#3|1,0,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,1,1,0|1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1|1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1|true) it was  trained on piano performances. and it seems
to have midi in and midi out
i read about it [here](http://innovativeteams.net/practical-examples-tensorflow-js-bringing-ml-browser/)
and some other apps built with the [magentajs](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/demos/web/) framework?

this was also where i heard the [catflute](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/nsynth-instrument) that merged a cat meow and
a flute? together
