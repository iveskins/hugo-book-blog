Taiwan is a four-stage online and offline process for moving from issue to legislative enactment while building consensus among diverse stakeholders. It has been used to craft 26 pieces of legislation relating to the digital economy collaboratively between the government and the public. vTaiwan relies on a series of existing open source tools (meaning they can be freely modified and customized, as needed). The process begins with a member of the public proposing an issue and a relevant government agency agreeing to steward and participate in the process. Since 2017, each Ministry is obliged to appoint a Participation Officer responsible for engaging in the process.
